                <p class="col-lg-8 mx-auto lead">
                    I am a first generation college graduate from Binghamton University. With a Bachelor's degree in Finance and Marketing and with my MBA in Management Information Systems and Business Analytics, I have developed a solid foundation in analytical thinking, quantitative analysis, and problem-solving skills that has prepared me for any analyst role.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm a finance enthusiast with a keen eye for technology-driven solutions. My journey into the world of finance started during my undergraduate years, where I honed my skills in financial analysis, risk management, and investment strategies. However, it was my fascination with fintech that led me to explore the dynamic intersection of finance and technology.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    During my academic journey, I had the privilege of being involved in various organizations such as Alpha Kappa Psi and the Student Association Congress at Binghamton University, where I worked closely with their financial teams. This experience allowed me to witness the interesting world of financial markets and get a little preview.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It wasn't until my senior year where I first messed with Python and realized the limitless potential within it. My first though was to combine it with my financial knowledge and that is when I discovered the world of fintech and my world changed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This led to me firmly believing that technology can serve as a catalyst for positive change in the financial industry. I am committed to staying at the forefront of fintech innovations, continually learning, and leveraging these advancements to create a positive impact on people's financial lives.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After that I decided to do my MBA right after and improve my skills and knowledge of coding and to see how I can incorporate it into the world of Finance which led to my independent study of how machine learning can predict stock prices on a day to day basis.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I hope you could relate to my story and how I got into Finance and programming and feel free to reach out to me via email at pedrocouto12@outlook.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm always open to discussing fintech, finance, and potential collaboration opportunities.
